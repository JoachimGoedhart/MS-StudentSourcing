      <abstract>
        <p>Data that is generated by students during a course is often lost as
there is no central, structured storage of those data. The loss of data
prevents its re-use. To enable re-use of the data, I present an approach
to collect, aggregate and re-use data that is generated by students in a
practical course on cell biology. The course runs annually and I have
recorded the data that was generated by students over 3 years. Two
use-cases illustrate how this data can be aggregated and re-used either
for the scientific record or for teaching. As the data is obtained by
different students, in different groups, over different years, it is an
excellent opportunity to discuss experimental design and modern data
visualization methods such as the superplot. The first use-case shows
how central data storage provides a unique opportunity to get precise
quantitative data due to the large sample size. The second use-case
demonstrates how the data can be presented as an online, interactive
dashboard, providing real-time data of the measurements. Both use cases
illustrate how data can be effectively aggregated and re-used.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Teaching practical skills in a lab course is a crucial part of
  education in biology, biomedical science, and life sciences. In these
  lab courses data is generated, reported and interpreted, much like
  <italic>real</italic> experimental lab work. However, students use
  their data just for their own lab report and the data is not centrally
  stored or aggregated. As a consequence, most of the data that is
  gathered in a lab course is lost. Yet, these data are potentially
  useful. Especially for larger course, an impressive amount of data
  under well-controlled conditions can be generated. Therefore, by
  collecting and aggregating the data of multiple students over multiple
  years, one can easily gather a large dataset with high numbers of
  independent observations, or as defined by Lazic, Clarke-Williams, and
  Munafò
  (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-lazic2018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>),
  biological replicates and experimental units.</p>
      <p>Microscopy is an essential tool in cell biology. The use of
  microscopes to observe cells and organisms has changed from a
  qualitative, descriptive approach, into a quantitative method

  <xref alt="Waters 2009" rid="ref-waters2009" ref-type="bibr">Waters

  software has catalyzed this transition
  (<xref alt="Carpenter 2007" rid="ref-carpenter2007" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter
  2007</xref>). Therefore, experiments that use microscopes are often
  followed by bioimage analysis to extract quantitative information from
  the data. To teach these skills, we combine a basic course on
  microscopy in a course on cell biology with teaching image processing
  and analysis in ImageJ/FIJI
  (<xref alt="Schneider, Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012" rid="ref-schneider2012" ref-type="bibr">Schneider,
  Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012</xref>). In a typical year, over one
  hundred students are enrolled in this course and therefore, a
  substantial amount of data is generated in the course.</p>
      <p>We decided to collect the data that was generated by the students
  in the lab course over several years and store the measurement results
  in a central location. The data by itself can be valuable for the
  scientific community as precise estimates with good statistics can be
  obtained. Moreover, the data are a starting point to discuss data
  visualization, experimental design and how experimental design affects
  the statistics and interpretation of data. Here, we report the methods
  to collect, process and visualize the data and demonstrate some of the
  ways the data can be re-used.</p>

        </p>
        <p>HeLa cells are cultured according to standard procedures and
    seeded 1 or 2 days before the treatment on 12 mm diameter glass
    coverslips. HeLa cells are incubated with 10 µM EdU for 30 minutes
    at 37 ˚C. The cells are fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and
    permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Click chemistry is
    performed with 9 µM Cy3-azide and 2 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. To start
    the reaction, 20 mg/ml ascorbate (final concentration) is added and
    the solution is used immediately to stain the cells. After 30
    minutes, the cells are washed 3x with PBS and the sample is
    incubated with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 minutes. Samples are mounted in
    Mowiol and used for observation with fluorescence microscopy. Images
    of at least 100 cells are acquired with the DAPI and TRITC filters
    sets. The nuclei in both channels are counted by hand, or in an
    automated way by segmentation and ‘particle analysis’ in imageJ to
    calculate the percentage of cells that are positive for Cy3
    fluorescence, reflecting cells in the S-phase.</p>

        <p>The data of the measurements is collected on voluntary basis

    (A/B/C/D), the percentage of cells in the S-phase for two methods,
    i.e. manual and using ImageJ/FIJI. The form is easy to set up and
    the data is collected in Google Sheets, yielding four columns;
    Timestamp, Group, and two columns with percentages of S-phase
    determined by the two methods.</p>

        <p>A buccal swab is used to harvest cheek cells by scraping ~5 times
    over the inside of the cheek. The tip of the sample collector is
    dipped into an eppendorf tube with 40 µl PBS, and the cells are
    transferred to an object slide by touching the slide with the tip.
    Next, 10 µl of 0.1% methyleneblue solution is added and the sample
    is enclosed by a square coverslip (22 x 22 mm). The sample is used
    immediately to observe the cells with a Leica microscope, equipped
    with a Lumenera camera. A 20x or 40x objective is used to observe
    and image the cells. A separate image of a micrometer

        <title>Use case 1: Determination of the percentage of cells in
    S-phase</title>
        <p>The aim of the experiment is is to determine the number of cells,
    as percentage, that are in the S-phase. To this end, students stain
    cells that are treated with EdU and they use these samples to
    quantify the percentage of cells in the S-phase in two ways (manual
    and semi-automated). The results are uploaded via a Google Form. The
    collected data can be analysed in multiple ways and here we used it
    to compare the two analysis methods and, secondly, to obtain an
    estimate for the percentage of S-phase cells. The data on the two
    analysis methods, manual and automated, is paired and can be
    visualised by a doplot in which the pairs of the data are connected
    (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-paired-data">Figure 1</xref>). The
    slopes of the lines vary a lot, whereas the average values per year
    between the two methods is similar. This implies that there can be
    substantial differences between the two methods, with roughly a
    similar number of cases where the automated analysis over- or
    underestimates the percentage, relative to the manual analysis.</p>
        <fig id="fig-paired-data">

        <p>There is increasing attention on effects of experimental design
    on data analysis and visualization. The recently proposed superplot
    to distinguish biological and technical replicates is an intuitive
    and straightforward way to communicate the design
    (<xref alt="Lord et al. 2020" rid="ref-lord2020" ref-type="bibr">Lord
    et al. 2020</xref>). The data on S-phase consists of both technical
    and biological replicates and is therefore ideally suited to explain
    the importance of correctly identifying the independent
    measurements. Here, we treat the data from each group as biological
    replicate, and the measurements within each group as a technical
    replicate. The reason is that a group of students all stain cells
    that are from the same passage number and treated at the same time
    and is therefore a technical replicate. On the other hand, different
    groups stain different passages of cells and so we treat these as
    independent observations. When the data is plotted for each
    individual technical replicate
    (<xref alt="Figure 2" rid="fig-superplot">Figure 2</xref>), it can
    be observed that we received multiple submissions per group, leading
    to a precise measurement per group. The median values range from 23%
    to 44%. The average value of the independent observations is 36.7%
    [N=12, 95%CI = 33.0%-40.3%].</p>

        <title>Use case 2: Comparing new results with historical
    data</title>
        <p>The aim of the experiment is to determine the average size
    (diameter) of a human cheek cell and nucleus. To this end, the
    students acquire images of their own, stained cheek cells and
    measure the size of the cell and its nucleus. At least 10
    measurements are made and the data are uploaded with a Google form.
    Each sample is an independent observation as it originates from a
    unique human specimen. The main learning objective for the students
    is to carry out the cell size measurements based on the images that
    are acquired. One important aspect to get to the right solution is
    the correct calibration of the field of view with a micro ruler.
    When the calibration is done incorrectly, this will affect the
    accuracy of the measurement, usually by an order of magnitude. To
    evaluate their results, the students can compare their own data with
    the historical data that is displayed on an online, interactive
    dashboard:
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/CellSizeR/">https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/CellSizeR/</ext-link>.
    On the dashboard, users can select the data from all measurements,
    or from a single year. A histogram visualizes the distribution of
    individual data for both the cell and the nucleus and the bins of
    the histogram can be adjusted. Since the sizes vary susbtantially,
    the data can be shown on a log-scale as well
    (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-histogram">Figure 3</xref>). The
    dashboard shows the same graph as depicted in
    <xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-histogram">Figure 3</xref>, but it is
    interactive in the sense that by hovering over the plots, the exact
    values of the data can be inferred as well. The dashboard also shows
    the data for the 4 different groups and the size distribution of the
    cells by violin plots.</p>
        <fig id="fig-histogram">
          <caption>
            <p>Figure 3: Distribution of the measured size of human

        </fig>
        <p>The dashboard clearly shows a multimodal distribution of the
    results, which is caused by a set of incorrect measurements due to
    incorrect calibration. Still, if we assume that the majority of
    measurements is correct, it is possible for the students to make a
    fair comparison and discuss their results in the context of the
    historical data.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Data that is generated in courses is often recorded by individual
  students or groups of students in reports. However, it can be valuable
  and interesting to collect and use these data. Here, I present a
  flexible and open-source approach to collect and display data from a
  large group of students and over several years. A combination of
  Google Forms/Sheets for data collection and R for data processing and
  visualization is used. In the first use case, a R Markdown template is
  used to process and visualize the data. In the second use case, the
  data is displayed in dashboard style. The code is available and can be
  used as a starting point for the processing and visualization of other
  datasets.</p>
      <p>Collecting and reusing the data has a number of advantageous
  aspects. First, a high number of measurements increases the precision
  of the measurement and therefore allows us to obtain precise numbers.
  Second, the historical data can be shared with the students and they
  can interpret and discuss their results in light of the existing data.
  Third, the obtained data serves as material that can be used to teach
  data manipulation, statistics and data visualization which is a
  fundamental aspect of science
  (<xref alt="Sailem, Cooper, and Bakal 2016" rid="ref-sailem2016" ref-type="bibr">Sailem,
  Cooper, and Bakal 2016</xref>). The use cases described in this paper
  deal with these aspects.</p>
      <p>The aggregation of the data inevitably leads to a discussion on
  experimental design, as this is important to establish whether
  measurements are independent or not. This aspect of experimental
  design has received attention over the last years
  (<xref alt="Aarts et al. 2015" rid="ref-Aarts2015" ref-type="bibr">Aarts
  et al. 2015</xref>;
  <xref alt="Sikkel et al. 2017" rid="ref-sikkel2017" ref-type="bibr">Sikkel
  et al. 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Eisner 2021" rid="ref-eisner2021" ref-type="bibr">Eisner
  2021</xref>) and it is valuable to teach this aspect of data analysis
  and visualization. Although I have not implemented this yet, I think
  that having students participate in the data aggregation, creates a
  very practical opportunity to teach experimental design and the
  identification of biological units
  (<xref alt="Lazic, Clarke-Williams, and Munafò 2018" rid="ref-lazic2018" ref-type="bibr">Lazic,
  Clarke-Williams, and Munafò 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, I feel it is valuable to collect data from practical
  courses and here we report one way to achieve that. I hope that serves
  as a starting point for others that want to collect, store and use
  data from large groups of students.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Data that is generated by students during a course is often lost as
there is no central, structured storage of those data. The loss of data
prevents its re-use. To enable re-use of the data, I present an approach
to collect, aggregate and re-use data that is generated by students in a
practical course on cell biology. The course runs annually and I have
recorded the data that was generated by students over 3 years. Two
use-cases illustrate how this data can be aggregated and re-used either
for the scientific record or for teaching. As the data is obtained by
different students, in different groups, over different years, it is an
excellent opportunity to discuss experimental design and modern data
visualization methods such as the superplot. The first use-case shows
how central data storage provides a unique opportunity to get precise
quantitative data due to the large sample size. The second use-case
demonstrates how the data can be presented as an online, interactive
dashboard, providing real-time data of the measurements. Both use cases
illustrate how data can be effectively aggregated and re-used.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Teaching practical skills in a lab course is a crucial part of
  education in biology, biomedical science, and life sciences. In these
  lab courses data is generated, reported and interpreted, much like
  <italic>real</italic> experimental lab work. However, students use
  their data just for their own lab report and the data is not centrally
  stored or aggregated. As a consequence, most of the data that is
  gathered in a lab course is lost. Yet, these data are potentially
  useful. Especially for larger course, an impressive amount of data
  under well-controlled conditions can be generated. Therefore, by
  collecting and aggregating the data of multiple students over multiple
  years, one can easily gather a large dataset with high numbers of
  independent observations, or as defined by Lazic, Clarke-Williams, and
  Munafò

        <p>Microscopy is an essential tool in cell biology. The use of
  microscopes to observe cells and organisms has changed from a
  qualitative, descriptive approach, into a quantitative method

  <xref alt="Waters 2009" rid="ref-waters2009-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Waters

  software has catalyzed this transition
  (<xref alt="Carpenter 2007" rid="ref-carpenter2007-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter
  2007</xref>). Therefore, experiments that use microscopes are often
  followed by bioimage analysis to extract quantitative information from
  the data. To teach these skills, we combine a basic course on
  microscopy in a course on cell biology with teaching image processing
  and analysis in ImageJ/FIJI
  (<xref alt="Schneider, Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012" rid="ref-schneider2012-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Schneider,
  Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012</xref>). In a typical year, over one
  hundred students are enrolled in this course and therefore, a
  substantial amount of data is generated in the course.</p>
        <p>We decided to collect the data that was generated by the students
  in the lab course over several years and store the measurement results
  in a central location. The data by itself can be valuable for the
  scientific community as precise estimates with good statistics can be
  obtained. Moreover, the data are a starting point to discuss data
  visualization, experimental design and how experimental design affects
  the statistics and interpretation of data. Here, we report the methods
  to collect, process and visualize the data and demonstrate some of the
  ways the data can be re-used.</p>

          <p>HeLa cells are cultured according to standard procedures and
    seeded 1 or 2 days before the treatment on 12 mm diameter glass
    coverslips. HeLa cells are incubated with 10 µM EdU for 30 minutes
    at 37 ˚C. The cells are fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and
    permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Click chemistry is
    performed with 9 µM Cy3-azide and 2 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. To start
    the reaction, 20 mg/ml ascorbate (final concentration) is added and
    the solution is used immediately to stain the cells. After 30
    minutes, the cells are washed 3x with PBS and the sample is
    incubated with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 minutes. Samples are mounted in
    Mowiol and used for observation with fluorescence microscopy. Images
    of at least 100 cells are acquired with the DAPI and TRITC filters
    sets. The nuclei in both channels are counted by hand, or in an
    automated way by segmentation and ‘particle analysis’ in imageJ to
    calculate the percentage of cells that are positive for Cy3
    fluorescence, reflecting cells in the S-phase.</p>

          <p>A buccal swab is used to harvest cheek cells by scraping ~5 times
    over the inside of the cheek. The tip of the sample collector is
    dipped into an eppendorf tube with 40 µl PBS, and the cells are
    transferred to an object slide by touching the slide with the tip.
    Next, 10 µl of 0.1% methyleneblue solution is added and the sample
    is enclosed by a square coverslip (22 x 22 mm). The sample is used
    immediately to observe the cells with a Leica microscope, equipped
    with a Lumenera camera. A 20x or 40x objective is used to observe
    and image the cells. A separate image of a micrometer
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/stage-graticules-s8/5028481">Electron

    are calibrated with the micrometer image. The line tool is used to

          <title>Use case 1: Determination of the percentage of cells in
    S-phase</title>
          <p>The aim of the experiment is is to determine the number of cells,
    as percentage, that are in the S-phase. To this end, students stain
    cells that are treated with EdU and they use these samples to
    quantify the percentage of cells in the S-phase in two ways (manual
    and semi-automated). The results are uploaded via a Google Form. The
    collected data can be analysed in multiple ways and here we used it
    to compare the two analysis methods and, secondly, to obtain an
    estimate for the percentage of S-phase cells. The data on the two
    analysis methods, manual and automated, is paired and can be
    visualised by a doplot in which the pairs of the data are connected
    (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-paired-data-nb-article">Figure 1</xref>). The
    slopes of the lines vary a lot, whereas the average values per year
    between the two methods is similar. This implies that there can be
    substantial differences between the two methods, with roughly a
    similar number of cases where the automated analysis over- or
    underestimates the percentage, relative to the manual analysis.</p>

          <p>There is increasing attention on effects of experimental design
    on data analysis and visualization. The recently proposed superplot
    to distinguish biological and technical replicates is an intuitive
    and straightforward way to communicate the design
    (<xref alt="Lord et al. 2020" rid="ref-lord2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Lord
    et al. 2020</xref>). The data on S-phase consists of both technical
    and biological replicates and is therefore ideally suited to explain
    the importance of correctly identifying the independent
    measurements. Here, we treat the data from each group as biological
    replicate, and the measurements within each group as a technical
    replicate. The reason is that a group of students all stain cells
    that are from the same passage number and treated at the same time
    and is therefore a technical replicate. On the other hand, different
    groups stain different passages of cells and so we treat these as
    independent observations. When the data is plotted for each
    individual technical replicate
    (<xref alt="Figure 2" rid="fig-superplot-nb-article">Figure 2</xref>), it can
    be observed that we received multiple submissions per group, leading
    to a precise measurement per group. The median values range from 23%
    to 44%. The average value of the independent observations is 36.7%

          <title>Use case 2: Comparing new results with historical
    data</title>
          <p>The aim of the experiment is to determine the average size
    (diameter) of a human cheek cell and nucleus. To this end, the
    students acquire images of their own, stained cheek cells and
    measure the size of the cell and its nucleus. At least 10
    measurements are made and the data are uploaded with a Google form.
    Each sample is an independent observation as it originates from a
    unique human specimen. The main learning objective for the students
    is to carry out the cell size measurements based on the images that
    are acquired. One important aspect to get to the right solution is
    the correct calibration of the field of view with a micro ruler.
    When the calibration is done incorrectly, this will affect the
    accuracy of the measurement, usually by an order of magnitude. To
    evaluate their results, the students can compare their own data with
    the historical data that is displayed on an online, interactive
    dashboard:
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/CellSizeR/">https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/CellSizeR/</ext-link>.
    On the dashboard, users can select the data from all measurements,
    or from a single year. A histogram visualizes the distribution of
    individual data for both the cell and the nucleus and the bins of
    the histogram can be adjusted. Since the sizes vary susbtantially,
    the data can be shown on a log-scale as well
    (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-histogram-nb-article">Figure 3</xref>). The
    dashboard shows the same graph as depicted in
    <xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-histogram-nb-article">Figure 3</xref>, but it is
    interactive in the sense that by hovering over the plots, the exact
    values of the data can be inferred as well. The dashboard also shows
    the data for the 4 different groups and the size distribution of the
    cells by violin plots.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Data that is generated in courses is often recorded by individual
  students or groups of students in reports. However, it can be valuable
  and interesting to collect and use these data. Here, I present a
  flexible and open-source approach to collect and display data from a
  large group of students and over several years. A combination of
  Google Forms/Sheets for data collection and R for data processing and
  visualization is used. In the first use case, a R Markdown template is
  used to process and visualize the data. In the second use case, the
  data is displayed in dashboard style. The code is available and can be
  used as a starting point for the processing and visualization of other
  datasets.</p>
        <p>Collecting and reusing the data has a number of advantageous
  aspects. First, a high number of measurements increases the precision
  of the measurement and therefore allows us to obtain precise numbers.
  Second, the historical data can be shared with the students and they
  can interpret and discuss their results in light of the existing data.
  Third, the obtained data serves as material that can be used to teach
  data manipulation, statistics and data visualization which is a
  fundamental aspect of science
  (<xref alt="Sailem, Cooper, and Bakal 2016" rid="ref-sailem2016-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Sailem,
  Cooper, and Bakal 2016</xref>). The use cases described in this paper
  deal with these aspects.</p>
        <p>The aggregation of the data inevitably leads to a discussion on
  experimental design, as this is important to establish whether
  measurements are independent or not. This aspect of experimental
  design has received attention over the last years
  (<xref alt="Aarts et al. 2015" rid="ref-Aarts2015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Aarts
  et al. 2015</xref>;
  <xref alt="Sikkel et al. 2017" rid="ref-sikkel2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Sikkel
  et al. 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Eisner 2021" rid="ref-eisner2021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Eisner
  2021</xref>) and it is valuable to teach this aspect of data analysis
  and visualization. Although I have not implemented this yet, I think
  that having students participate in the data aggregation, creates a
  very practical opportunity to teach experimental design and the
  identification of biological units
  (<xref alt="Lazic, Clarke-Williams, and Munafò 2018" rid="ref-lazic2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Lazic,
  Clarke-Williams, and Munafò 2018</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, I feel it is valuable to collect data from practical
  courses and here we report one way to achieve that. I hope that serves
  as a starting point for others that want to collect, store and use
  data from large groups of students.</p>
