This is a shame, as it is a great opportunity to collect data from a large amount of samples. Here, we present an approach to collect, aggregate and re-use data that is generated by students in a practical course on cell biology. Several use-cases are discussed that illustrate how data can be re-used eihter in teaching or for the scientific record. A positive side-effect is that the students learn that their data is valuable.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Data acquired by students has value and in this work we present several ways to collect and re-use that data.\nkey-points:\n  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis\n  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n\n## Introduction {#sec-introduction}\n\nTeaching practical skills in a lab course is a crucial part of education in biology, biomedical science, and life sciences. In these lab courses data is generated, reported and interpreted, much like *real* experimental lab work. However, students use their data just for their own lab report and the data is not centrally stored or aggregated. As a consequence, most of the data that is gathered in a lab course is lost. Yet, these data are potentially useful. Especially for larger course, an impressive amount of data under well-controlled conditions can be generated. Therefore, by collecting and aggregating the data of multiple students over multiple years, one can easily gather a large dataset with high numbers of independent observations, or as defined by @lazic2018, biological replicates and experimental units.\n\nMicroscopy is an essential tool in cell biology. The use of microscopes to observe cells and organisms has changed from a qualitative, descriptive approach, into a quantitative method [@senft2023; @renz2013; @wait2020; @waters2009]. The development of digital cameras and image analysis software has catalyzed this transition [@carpenter2007]. Therefore, experiments that use microscopes are often followed by bioimage analysis to extract quantitative information from the data. To teach these skills, we combine a basic course on microscopy in a course on cell biology with teaching image processing and analysis in ImageJ/FIJI [@schneider2012]. In a typical year, over one hundred students are enrolled in this course and therefore, a substantial amount of data is generated in the course.\n\nWe decided to collect the data that was generated by the students in the lab course over several years and store the measurement results in a central location. The data by itself can be valuable for the scientific community as precise estimates with good statistics can be obtained. Moreover, the data are a starting point to discuss data visualization, experimental design and how experimental design affects the statistics and interpretation of data. Here, we report the methods to collect, process and visualize the data and demonstrate some of the ways the data can be re-used.\n\n## Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n### Use case 1\n\n*Sample preparation and measurements*\n\nHeLa cells are cultured according to standard procedures and seeded 1 or 2 days before the treatment on 12 mm diameter glass coverslips. HeLa cells are incubated with 10 µM EdU for 30 minutes at 37 ˚C. The cells are fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Click chemistry is performed with 9 µM Cy3-azide and 2 mM CuSO~4~. To start the reaction, 20 mg/ml ascorbate (final concentration) is added and the solution is used immediately to stain the cells. After 30 minutes, the cells are washed 3x with PBS and the sample is incubated with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 minutes. Samples are mounted in Mowiol and used for observation with fluorescence microscopy. Images of at least 100 cells are acquired with the DAPI and TRITC filters sets. The nuclei in both channels are counted by hand, or in an automated way by segmentation and 'particle analysis' in imageJ to calculate the percentage of cells that are positive for Cy3 fluorescence, reflecting cells in the S-phase.\n\n*Data collection*\n\nThe data of the measurements is collected on voluntary basis through a Google Form, an example of which is shown in *figure XX*. The data that is recorded is the group (A/B/C/D), the percentage of cells in the S-phase for two methods, i.e. manual and using ImageJ/FIJI. The form is easy to set up and the data is collected in Google Sheets, yielding four columns; Timestamp, Group, and two columns with percentages of S-phase determined by the two methods.\n\n*Data processing & visualization*\n\nThe data that is in the Google Sheet can be downloaded and read into R [@RCore] as a CSV. All subsequent processing and data visualization is done with `{rmarkdown}` [@RMarkdown]. The R Markdown file and a rendered version as HTML are available on Github: <https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/PreciSeR>. The cleaning of the data consists of removing empty cells, changing the column names, conversion to a tidy format, forcing the data into a 'numeric' type and filtering for sensible values (anything outside the generous range of 0-100 will be removed).\n\n### Use case 2\n\n*Sample preparation and measurements*\n\nA buccal swab is used to harvest cheek cells by scraping \\~5 times over the inside of the cheek. The tip of the sample collector is dipped into an eppendorf tube with 40 µl PBS, and the cells are transferred to an object slide by touching the slide with the tip. Next, 10 µl of 0.1% methyleneblue solution is added and the sample is enclosed by a square coverslip (22 x 22 mm). The sample is used immediately to observe the cells with a Leica microscope, equipped with a Lumenera camera. A 20x or 40x objective is used to observe and image the cells. A separate image of a micrometer ([Electron Microscopy Sciences 6804208, Stage Micrometer S8, Horizontal Scale, 1 mm Length](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/stage-graticules-s8/5028481)) is acquired at the same magnification. The images are processed in ImageJ/FIJI and the dimensions of the images are calibrated with the micrometer image. The line tool is used to measure the diameter of the cells (the longest axis).\n\n*Data collection*\n\nThe data of the measurements is collected through a Google Form, an example of which is shown in *figure XX*. The data that is recorded by the form is the group (A/B/C/D), the size measurements of the cheek cells and the size measurements of the nucleus. The data is aggregated in a Google Sheet which has four columns with data on Timestamp, Group, size of cells, size of nuclei. When correctly uploaded, the two columns with the size data have comma separated values of 10 measurements.\n\n*Data processing*\n\nThe data that is in the Google Sheet can be downloaded and read into R as a CSV. All subsequent processing and data visualisation and presentation in dashboard style is done in R. The code is available on Github: <https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/CellSizeR>. The cleaning of the data consist of removing empty cells, changing the column names, listing all individual measurements in a single row, forcing the data into a 'numeric' type and filtering for sensible values (anything outside the generous range of 0-1000 will be removed). A detailed protocol that explains the processing is available as protocol 10 [@goedhart2022].\n\n*Data visualisation*\n\nA dashboard is composed in R Markdown with the `{flexdashboard}` package. The code is available here: <https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/CellSizeR> and the live dashboard is available online: <https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/CellSizeR/>\n\n## Results {#sec-results}\n\n### Use case 1\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/PreciSe.qmd#fig-paired-data >}}\n\n\n\n### Use case 2\n\n## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}\n\nData that is generated in courses is often recorded by individual students or groups of students in reports. However, it can be valuable and interesting to collect and use these data. Here, I present a flexible and open-source approach to collect and display data from a large group of students and over several years. A combination of Google Forms/Sheets for data collection and R for data processing and visualization is used. In the first use case, a R Markdown template is used to process and visualize the data. In the second use case, the data is displayed in dashboard style. The code is available and can be used as a starting point for the processing and visualization of other datasets.\n\nCollecting and reusing the data has a number of advantageous aspects. First, a high number of measurements increases the precision of the measurement and therefore allows us to obtain precise numbers. Second, the historical data can be shared with the students and they can interpret and discuss their results in light of the existing data. Third, the obtained data serves as material that can be used to teach data manipulation, statistics and data visualization which is a fundamental aspect of science [@sailem2016]. The use cases described in this paper deal with these aspects.\n\nThe aggregation of the data inevitably leads to a discussion on experimental design, as this is important to establish whether measurements are independent or not. This aspect of experimental design has received attention over the last years (SUPERPLOT, multilevelmodels, cluster analysis) and it is valuable to teach this aspect of data visualization and analysis. Although I have not implemented this yet, I think that having students participate in the data aggregation, creates a very practical opportunity to teach experimental design and the identification of biological units [@lazic2018].\n\nIn conclusion, I feel it is valuable to collect data from practical courses and here we report one way to achieve that. I hope that serves as a starting point for others that want to collect, store and use data from large groups of students.\n\n*The size measurements of the cheek cells match with previous findings by @romeo2006. The data on nucleus diameter correspond with data from @mourant2002.*\n\n### Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}\n\nA [blog post by Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/use-google-forms-and-r-to-track-data-easily/) helped to shape this project.\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-xxxx .cell warning.hidden='true' message.hidden='true'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell warning.hidden='true' message.hidden='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nx <- c(1,4,2,6)\navg <- mean(x)\n```\n:::\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\nH~2~O is a liquid. 2^10^ is 1024.\n",
